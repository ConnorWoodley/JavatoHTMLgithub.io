Attempting to put the IdleStarScreenSaver from the processing coding program onto the background of a website.

Currently looking at this as a sort of tutorial/teaching for music waves

Now currently looking at a way to drag/drop music into the program (this idea might change)
https://editor.p5js.org/Sophi333/sketches/2sTRc_moH
only issue is that it uses an external API. Which I do not prefer
<br />
** ** Progress Update ** **
finally solved the amplitude issue, so now the waveform visualizer can be implimented.
Some new ideas is to possibly make the song selection a sort of "drop file" type player,
where the user can use a computer to drop a file into the canvas which will then be saved
into an array where the songs can be displayed or selected. This should allow autoplay,
skipping songs, going back to songs, and having the user selected songs of their choosing
instead of having to deal with the pre-german-fantacizing-era of kanye songs I enjoy.
